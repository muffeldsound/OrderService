Thanks for taking the time to do refactoring exercise!
Here's the instructions from our team:

This solution contains some classes used by an imaginary service to generate order receipts and 
some unit tests to prove that everything works.

Pretend this code is part of a larger software system and you are now responsible for it. 
Assume that there will be the following changes coming: 
* different discounts and percentages
* receipt in json format

Refactor the code so that it can survive these changes. 
* Your code should trend towards being SOLID.
* You should be confident that it works. 
* You should be comfortable the next developer will easily understand how to work with it.
* We use [NUnit3](http://www.nunit.org) and [FakeItEasy](https://fakeiteasy.github.io/) at Waypoint. References have been added using NuGet.

Please note. There is no right or wrong solution(s) for this task. 
Show us what you can do and we will discuss your refactoring choices during the technical interview. 

Good luck and, most importantly, have fun :)
